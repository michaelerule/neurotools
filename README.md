## Computational neuroscience python routines. 

This is a collection of python modules developed for exploratory analysis and statistical modeling in computational neuroscience. Most of the code and documentation is of "research" (i.e. poor) quality and unstable, but some of the modules are stable and useful. The (very much under construction) documentation [can be found on github pages](http://michaelerule.github.io/neurotools/_build/html/index.html).

This project depends on several scientific Python packages including [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [nipy](http://nipy.org/nitime/). For the most part the routines here do not duplicate the functionality of these packages. There is a focus on spatiotemporal modeling of multi-electrode array datasets, stochastic models of population dynamics, and some routines to explore population synchrony. There are also several playful or exploratory modules that probably aren't all that useful but are available nevertheless.

This project is published in the spirit (but not the letter) of the [tongue-and-cheek CRAPL license for academic code](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/CRAPL-LICENSE.txt). This is not a legal license as it contains internal inconsistencies (like forbidding users to exist). However, it contains a strong caution that this project has not been reviewed or prepared for use by the general public.

Please note that this license does not apply to the project as a whole, but only to those modules or functions for which an alternative license is not otherwise specified. This project aggregates several functions published informally (e.g. as stackoverflow answers or via gist). Routines taken from elsewhere are cited as such, with a link to the original source provided.
