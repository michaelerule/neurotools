This license is appropriate as the project contains substantial non-code content, and the code that it does contain is trivial. This project is published in the spirit (but not the letter) of the [tongue-and-cheek CRAPL license for academic code](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/CRAPL-LICENSE.txt). This is not a legal license as it contains internal inconsistencies (like forbidding users to exist). However, it contains a strong caution that this project has not been reviewed or prepared for use by the general public.
