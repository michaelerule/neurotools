## Python routines for neuroinformatics <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/687425/200168839-cd5d2fe4-4dc4-434f-a49c-e4b329e2cb7b.svg" width="80" />

[The documentation on github pages](http://michaelerule.github.io/neurotools/_build/html/index.html).

These are python routines for statistical modeling in computational neuroscience that I've collected over the years. 

This is "research code" (poor quality, untested), but some modules are stable and useful.  

Not to be confused with the [Neurotools project for neural simulation](http://neuralensemble.org/NeuroTools/).
