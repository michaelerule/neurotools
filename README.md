## Python routines for neuroinformatics <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/687425/200168839-cd5d2fe4-4dc4-434f-a49c-e4b329e2cb7b.svg" width="80" />

[Please see the documentation on github pages](http://michaelerule.github.io/neurotools/_build/html/index.html).

These are python routines for statistical modeling in computational neuroscience that I've collected over the years. Much of the project is "research" (i.e. poor) quality and unstable, but some of the modules are stable and useful.  This project is not to be confused with the [Neurotools project for neural simulation](http://neuralensemble.org/NeuroTools/).
