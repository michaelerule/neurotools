Welcome to Neurotools's documentation!
======================================

This is a collection of python modules developed for exploratory analysis and statistical modeling in computational neuroscience. Most of the code and documentation is of "research" (i.e. poor) quality and unstable, but some of the modules are stable and useful. Please refer to specific modules 
(see Module Index) for further documentation.

This project depends on several scientific Python packages including `numpy
<http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy
<https://www.scipy.org/>`_, `statsmodels
<http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html>`_, `pandas
<http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, and `nipy
<http://nipy.org/nitime/>`_. This project is not to be confused with the (much better organized) `Neurotools project for neural simulation
<http://neuralensemble.org/NeuroTools/>`_. For the most part the routines here do not duplicate the functionality of these packages. There is a focus on spatiotemporal modeling of multi-electrode array datasets, stochastic models of population dynamics, and some routines to explore population synchrony. There are also several playful or exploratory modules that probably aren't all that useful but are available nevertheless. The project source can be browsed or downloaded from `github
<https://github.com/michaelerule/neurotools>`_.
