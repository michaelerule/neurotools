Code dealing with closures in Python.

The default way that Python handles closures creates problems

    1   Late binding can cause suprising errors
    2   Closing over mutable state can cause surprising errors
    3   Mutable default arguments can causing surprising errors
    4   Closing over external state that may change across runs can cause
        surprising errors, as the same arguments may return different values
    5   Closing over extrenal state makes safe caching difficult, as we
        have to guarantee that the arguments, function source, subroutines,
        and closed-over state are all IDENTICAL before we can trust a
        cached value.

This module defines some decorators that improve safety, hopefully
automatically detecting functions that are likele to cause trouble.

    Checks if a function is "safe" (likely immutable)

    Formally this is quite tricky as not all closures can be avoided.
    Functions MUST close over their namespace in order to access
    subroutines later, as Python is by design late-binding. This cannot
    be avoided, and changes in subroutines may cause changes in behavior.

    Levels of safety:

    Safe:
        Function references only other functions. All state is passed
        via arguments. Hash values of subroutines are incorporated into
        the hash value for this function.

    Risky:
        Function may close over state and reference globals, as long as
        those states / globals are themselves immutable. This is risky
        as values may still change across invokation. In theory we could
        snapshot the dependent state and incorporate that into the call
        signature.

    Unsafe:
        Function contains mutable defaults. Function references mutable
        globals or closes over mutable state. Unsafe conditions will
        cause a ValueError
