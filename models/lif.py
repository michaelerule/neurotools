    Implement exponential moving average as

    This relates to convolving signal x with decaying exponential
    Y = X * [H(t) exp(-t/tau)]
    Where t is in seconds and H is the heaviside step function
    
    Alpha and tau may be related by considering the differential equation

    tau dY/dT = X-Y
    
    And both solving it as a linear equation and also re-writing it as a
    discrete difference equation
    
    DY = (X-Y) DT/tau
    [Y_{n+1}-Y] = (X-Y) DT/tau
    Y_{n+1} = (X-Y) DT/tau + Y
    Y_{n+1} = (1 - DT/tau) Y + DT/tau X
